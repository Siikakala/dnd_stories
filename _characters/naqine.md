Backstory:
Naqine was born to a noble family of Hardcastle in the bustling city of Arabel, Cormyr. From an early age, her striking wings—a deep indigo adorned with swirling silver patterns—and unique tiefling features set her apart. Though scorned by some for her otherworldly heritage, Naqine found solace in the arts of shadow magic that pulsed through her veins, a legacy from generations long forgotten. Her parents believed she was destined for greatness and enrolled her in advanced arcane studies at the Royal Academy of War Wizards.

Her wings fluttered softly as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the training grounds. Born to a lineage steeped in infernal heritage, her striking appearance marked her from an early age: fair skin gleaming like finest silk, eyes twinkling pink and sharp as pale rubies beneath cascading ebony hair, and the patterns in her wings shimmered in dim light. While some feared her tiefling blood, Naqine wanted to learn to weave enchantments from shadow itself, especially after her eyes changed color and her surroundings grew dark and gloomy when she cast her first spell, Mind Sliver, during a fight with her uncle "for having too many female lovers". The fight and the awakening of her powers were so influential that she abadoned her faith towards Siamorphe and after some visits at Lady's House, she decided to devote herself to Savras, in the hopes of  to aid with arcane arts and unveiling her origins.

Little she knew about the true origins of her race, appearance or sorcerous powers. Her parents are both human after all, but there's too often some shady business in some point in many noble lineages, and neither of her parents were exceptions. In fact, her father carried the blood touched by Rhyxali, the Queen of Shadow Demons and The Demon Princess of Shadow. Her mother seems to have direct lineage to Xinivrae, one of first three Succubi. Unfortunately the great powers of the two were long forgotten, laying mostly dormant, waiting for their chance to raise into greatness once more. And when these two lineages joined forces in Naqine, the touch of Abyss woke up both, granting the stunning looks of Xinivrae, in the indigo shades of Rhyxali. The ancient bloods sang in perfect harmony, complimenting each other, granting the mighty sorcerous power rooted in Rhyxali's secretive shadow, which seemed to somehow pierce through Abyss all the way into Shadowfell. Xinivrae twisted her race to tiefling, granted her wings and horns and caused her to prefer women - along with terrible lust. But, having born into noble family, Naqine was raised to be bright and cunning enough to take advantage of her ancient twisted shadowy succubi blood (and family connections for lovers), without realising what she is actually learning to wield.

During her training with the War Wizards, she discovered that not only could she decode ancient scripts and hidden messages—she could also manipulate shadows themselves to conceal or reveal secrets as needed. This duality made her invaluable; whispers began to circulate about "The Shadow Scribe," a title evoking awe and trepidation among foes and allies alike. With trusted friends at her side—and some whom suspicion cast heavy doubt upon—Naqine became embroiled in various clandestine missions across Old Cormyr, often risking herself for crucial intelligence on threats against their realm. Though it has helped that even after getting injured from unseen trap, it was almost like the shadow itself kept her blood inside the veins, leaving no trail behind.

Now cloaked in mystery like shadows themselves, Naqine walks between worlds—one foot rooted among allies willing to sacrifice everything for justice and another ever so slightly drifting amidst veils adorned with secrecy where betrayals brew unseen. Each espionage mission brings new challenges: deciphering hidden codes scribbled onto parchment glowing faintly with evocation runes or employing illusions draped over walls riddled with spies lurking just outside view while delving deeper into political intrigues than any heart dares imagine. Yet amid perpetual danger lies an exhilarating thrill blooming inside; each victory reminds Naqine not only why she chose this path but illuminates the person she's still striving to become—a guardian forged in darkness yet fiercely loyal to light battling ever onward toward whatever destiny awaits beyond each unfolding shadow-filled dawn.
